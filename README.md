# CS4782-Final-Project-LLMs-and-Arithmetic

3.1 Introduction
Provide a brief introduction to your project, including the chosen paper’s title, authors, and publication venue.
A brief description of the main method.
Explain the main contribution(s) of the paper.
3.2 Chosen Result
Identify the specific result you aimed to reproduce and its significance in the context of the paper’s main contribution(s).
Include the relevant figure, table, or equation reference from the original paper.
3.3 Re-implementation Details
Describe your re-implementation approach, including the model architec- ture, datasets, evaluation metrics, and any modifications made to the
riginal methodology.
Provide instructions for running your code, including any dependencies, required libraries, and command-line arguments.
Specify the computational resources (e.g., GPU) needed to reproduce your results.
3.4 Results and Analysis
Present your re-implementation results and compare them to the original paper’s findings.
Discuss any discrepancies or challenges encountered during the re-implementation process. If there is discrepancy between your results and the reported results, present a clear discussion of your hypotheses explaining the dis- crepancy.
Provide an analysis of your results in the context of the paper’s main contribution(s) and the broader research area.
Note: We are looking for a reasonable re-implementation of the method and a clear discussion of your results. A failure to match the reported results could happen for any number of reasons that would not negatively impact your grade. It is acceptable, for instance, to run smaller-scale experiments if you initially under-estimated the required resources for your selected result. It’s also possible that the authors left out some detail that is necessary to match their performance.
3.5 Conclusion and Future Work
Summarize the key takeaways from your re-implementation effort and the lessons learned.
Discuss potential future directions or extensions based on your findings and the paper’s implications.
3.6 References
• Include a list of references, including the original paper and any additional resources used in your re-implementation.
