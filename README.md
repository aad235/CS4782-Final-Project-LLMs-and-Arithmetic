# CS4782-Final-Project-LLMs-and-Arithmetic

<h2 dir="ltr">3.1 Introduction</h2> 
<ul dir="ltr"> 
  <li>Provide a brief introduction to your project, including the chosen paper’s title, authors, and publication venue.</li> 
  <li>A brief description of the main method.</li> 
  <li>Explain the main contribution(s) of the paper.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2 dir="ltr">3.2 Chosen Result</h2> 
<ul dir="ltr"> 
  <li>Identify the specific result you aimed to reproduce and its significance in the context of the paper’s main contribution(s).</li> 
  <li>Include the relevant figure, table, or equation reference from the original paper.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2 dir="ltr">3.3 Re-implementation Details</h2> 
<ul dir="ltr"> 
  <li>Describe your re-implementation approach, including the model architec- ture, datasets, evaluation metrics, and any modifications made to the
    <ul dir="ltr"> 
      <li>riginal methodology.</li> 
    </ul></li> 
  <li>Provide instructions for running your code, including any dependencies, required libraries, and command-line arguments.</li> 
  <li>Specify the computational resources (e.g., GPU) needed to reproduce your results.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2 dir="ltr">3.4 Results and Analysis</h2> 
<ul dir="ltr"> 
  <li>Present your re-implementation results and compare them to the original paper’s findings.</li> 
  <li>Discuss any discrepancies or challenges encountered during the re-implementation process. If there is discrepancy between your results and the reported results, present a clear discussion of your hypotheses explaining the dis- crepancy.</li> 
  <li>Provide an analysis of your results in the context of the paper’s main contribution(s) and the broader research area.</li> 
  <li>Note: We are looking for a reasonable re-implementation of the method and a clear discussion of your results. A failure to match the reported results could happen for any number of reasons that would not negatively impact your grade. It is acceptable, for instance, to run smaller-scale experiments if you initially under-estimated the required resources for your selected result. It’s also possible that the authors left out some detail that is necessary to match their performance.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2 dir="ltr">3.5 Conclusion and Future Work</h2> 
<ul dir="ltr"> 
  <li>Summarize the key takeaways from your re-implementation effort and the lessons learned.</li> 
  <li>Discuss potential future directions or extensions based on your findings and the paper’s implications.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2 dir="ltr">3.6 References</h2> 
<p dir="ltr">• Include a list of references, including the original paper and any additional resources used in your re-implementation.</p>
